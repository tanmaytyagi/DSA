		* Turn the interview in a conversation
	
	DSA Interview:
		Listen the questions
		` Reframe it and repeat
		` Ask all the details about the inputs
			Whether it's int, float, string, positive, negative
			In case of class and function Implementation
				Ask about read/write ratio
				Sparseness of binary string
				Whether to handle incorrect data, or just throw the exception
		` If you are assuming something, lets say book pages as index, then tell
		Think and tell about the solution first
		Clarifying questions if any
		` Tell time/space complexity before start Coding
		Code
		Write test cases
		Dry run

	DSA approaches:
		# Dynamic Programming (DP):
			When answer is easily gettable if you knew the answer of smaller question
			* Typical
				2-directional: 
					https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/submissions/1462619749/
			* Top-Down with Memoization (similar to recursion)
				Recursively break it down to smaller subproblems and store the results to use it later whenver it's required again
				~ Definitely solves the smaller problems first, but it's WHILE solving the bigger problems
				Avoid redundant repeatative calculations using Memoization
				e.g. Fibonacci numbers, Climbing Stairs, 0/1 Knapsack
			* Bottom-Up (Tabulation)
				Build up the solution from smallest unit first iteratively by solving all the subproblems first
				~ Need to solve the sub-problems first to solve the bigger problem later
				e.g. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS), Coin Change, Edit Distance
			* 3D dp:
				` https://leetcode.com/problems/burst-balloons/submissions/1467194807/
				https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-merge-stones/

					maintain a degree, check if all degree is even or not
					dfs(0)
					cout<< (result.size()==n+1) ?"Yes":"No";

					dfs(int node) {
						while (!graph[node].isEmpty()) {
							int neighbor = graph[node].remove(graph[node].size() - 1);
							long edgeId = getEdgeId(node, neighbor);
							if (visitedEdges.get(edgeId)) continue;
							visitedEdges.put(edgeId, true);
							dfs(neighbor);
						}
						result.add(node);
					}
			* Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP): 
				The objective is to visit every vertex exactly once and return to the starting vertex, while minimizing the total distance or cost of the tour
				https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/travelling-salesman-problem-using-dynamic-programming/

			e.g.
				Merge Sort: Sort array by dividing it into two parts
				Quick Sort: Sort an array using a pivot
		# Meet in the Middle

				N-Queens Problem: Place N queens on an NxN chessboard
				Sudoku Solver
				Combination Sum: Find all combinations of numbers that sum to a target

				Path finding: maintain parent of each node
				Connected Components: Find all connected components in a graph
				Round Trip II: maintain chain of dfs visited vertex
				Cycle Detection in Graph: Detect if a graph contains a cycle.
					Detect cycle in an undirected graph
						keep track of parent, if(visited[neigh except parent]==1) cycle detected in dfs
					Detect cycle in an directed graph
						Keep track of the visited nodes that are in the current dfs recursion stack
				Strongly Connected Components:
					have adjList and it's transpose
					foreach i if(!vis[i]) dfs(i, adj)
					Arrays.fill(vis, false);
					// a vector will be generated by this, use that for dfs2
					for(i=v.size()-1;i>-1;i--) if(!vis[v[i]]) dfs2(v[i], k++, adj2)
					foreach i:= if(comp[i]==-1) return -1;//not a SCC. failed to reach this node

					dfs(i, adj):= if(vis[i])return; vis[i]=1;  for(neigh:adj[i])dfs(i); V.push_BACK(i);
					dfs2(i,k,adj2):= if(vis[i])return; vis[i]=1; comp[i] = k; for(neigh:adj2[i])dfs2(i);

		# Breadth-First Search (BFS)

				Path direction:
					maintian 'where did you came from' for each node
				Minimum Depth of Binary Tree: Find the minimum depth of a binary tree.
				~ Level Order Traversal: Traverse a binary tree level by level
					Store length of queue at each level, before start processing it
			* Multi-source bfs

				Shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights
			* Floyd-Warshall
				Shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph
			* Planet queries (Binary jump)
				Given a transporter of each planet. Each planet has a teleporter to another planet (or the planet itself). 
					1. Determine if you start from a node, in k steps where you'll reach
					2. minimum steps to reach from a to b
				vector<vector<int>> v(n, vector<int>(30));
				for(i=0;i<n;i++) cin >> v[i][0];
				for(i=1;i<30;i++) for(j=0;j<n;j++) v[j][i] = v[v[j][i - 1]][i - 1];
				for (int i = 0; i < query.size(); i++) {
					for (int j = 0; j < 30; j++) {
						if (b & (1 << j)) {
							a = v[a][j];
						}
					}
				}
		# Union-Find (Disjoint Set)
			Implementation:
				Initially: foreach i par[i]=i
				Union:	union(x,y) := parent[find(y)]=find(x)
				Find: find(x):= if(parent[x]!=x) return find(parent[x]) else return x;
			Kruskal’s Algorithm: Find the Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph.
				Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight. 
				Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far. If the cycle is not formed, include this edge. Else, discard it. 
				Repeat step#2 until there are (V-1) edges in the spanning tree.
			Number of Islands: Find the number of islands in a grid
			Worst case Time Complexity:
				The worst-case time complexity of the Union-Find (Disjoint Set) algorithm depends on how the data structure is implemented. Specifically, the complexity is determined by the techniques used to optimize the operations: path compression and union by rank/size.

				1. Basic Union-Find (No Optimization)

					•	Union Operation: ￼
					•	In the worst case, one tree is added as a child of another without considering their sizes or depths, leading to highly unbalanced trees.
					•	Find Operation: ￼
					•	Without optimization, the find operation might traverse the entire height of an unbalanced tree.

				2. Optimized Union-Find (with Path Compression and Union by Rank/Size)

					•	Union Operation: ￼
					•	Union by rank/size ensures smaller trees are attached to larger trees, keeping the tree height low.
					•	Find Operation: ￼
					•	Path compression flattens the tree structure, making subsequent find operations faster.

				Here:
					•	is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows extremely slowly.
					•	For all practical purposes, ￼ for any reasonable value of ￼, even for values as large as ￼.

				Overall Complexity (Optimized Implementation)

				For ￼ operations (unions or finds) on ￼ elements:
					•	Time Complexity: ￼

				Why is ￼ So Small?

				The Ackermann function, ￼, grows extremely fast, so its inverse grows extremely slowly. The inverse Ackermann function, ￼, is defined as the smallest ￼ such that:

				￼

				For practical scenarios:
					•	If ￼, then ￼.

				This means that for all real-world applications, the operations are nearly constant time.

				Conclusion

					•	Worst-case Time Complexity (Optimized): ￼ per operation.
					•	Practical Time Complexity: ￼ per operation due to the small value of ￼.
		# Topological Sorting
			Linear ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
			When solving one problem leads to solve other problems

			Self balancing tree:
				AVL:
					All nodes should be balanced, do shifting as many at required
					Node insert(node, key){
						if(node==null) return new Node(key);
						if(node.val==key) return node;
						if(key<node.val) node.left=insert(node.left,key)
						else node.right=insert(node.right, key)
						node.height = 1+max(depth(node.left), depth(node.right))
						int balance = depth(node.left)-depth(node.right)
						if(balance>1||balance<-1){
							(node=y) y->left=x; x->right=z;     <==>    x->right=y; y->left=z;  (node=x)
						}

			1's Complement: ~n
			2's Complement: (~n)+1 = -n
			i & -i
				isolates the rightmost set bit (the lowest 1) 20:4, 22:2, 18:2, 19:1
			i - (i & (i - 1))
				same as i & -i
				i-1 := flips all the bits right of right set bit(including that set bit)
				i&(i-1) := the all bits same as before the rightmost set bit

			e.g.
				Single Number:
				Next Power of Two:

							while (n > 0) {
								n = n & (n - 1); // Removes the lowest set bit
								count++;
							}
							return count;
						}
					Position of the Lowest Set Bit:
						n = n-(n&(n-1)) := 8->8, 15->1, 16->16, 10->2

					(SegmentTreeNode { int start, end, value; SegmentTreeNode left, right;})
					Populate segment tree: populate(int[] nums, int start, int end)
					Update segment tree: update(SegmentTreeNode node, int index, int value)
					Read Segment tree: rangeQuery(SegmentTreeNode node, int left, int right)
						check whether current node's start and end is  overlapping totally(value), partially(sum of each child) or partially(0)

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]

Output: 5

Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.

Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]

Output: 0

Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

 

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 105
0 <= prices[i] <= 104
